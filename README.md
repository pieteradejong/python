# Algorithms in Python

Since Python lends itself extremely well toward mathematics and algorithms,
this repo will contain my projects in that area.

## Interesting algortihms:
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation
* Various distance metrics in R^n space
* Bayesian statistics
* Financial mathematics e.g. dv01
